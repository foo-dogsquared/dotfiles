= dotfiles
:toc:

My dotfiles for my Linux-based system setup.
The structure of this repo is designed to be managed with https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow], a symlinks farm manager.

I don't know what I'm doing most of the time in creating this setup so if you're brave (or suicidal) enough to take a look at my stuff, go ahead.

CAUTION: As they always say: "Don't blindly apply these dotfiles unless you know what you're doing."
Review the code first, change the setting accordingly, and apply it on your own if you want.

== Tour of my setup

Here's what the setup should look like (aside from the Stow packages which will be discussed later):

[source]
----
dotfiles
├── docs/
├── LICENSE
├── locations.json
├── makefile
├── README.adoc
└── vtsm
----

The big picture for my dotfiles setup have big goals and those are (according to priority):

* Easy to transfer and/or reproduce.
* Modularity, https://github.com/holman/dotfiles[@holman]-style.
* Looking cool (but not too cool or else my potato will weep).


=== How I maintain my dotfiles

The dotfiles are mostly intended to be used with GNU Stow.
If you're not familiar with it, you can read http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html[this sweet short article] to get you started.

However, with Python 3 (specifically 3.8) installed, you have another option.
Behold, the link:./vtsm["Very Tiny Stow Manager"] (VTSM for short)!
VTSM takes inspiration from GNU Stow (obviously) and https://github.com/holman/dotfiles[how Zach Holman's dotfiles are set].
When managing your dotfiles, VTSM is going to be your friend/workmate.

Using VTSM should be simple and it is nothing special, really.
All it needs is a directory containing a file named `locations.json` with the name of the packages and their target path.
VTSM will simply run commands with those packages.
In short, it's just a shell runner set by a data file.

.An example of what `locations.json` could be
[source, json]
----
{
    "alacritty": "$HOME/.config/alacritty/",
    "bin": "$HOME/bin/",
    "bspwm": "$HOME/.config/bspwm/",
    "dunst": "$HOME/.config/dunst/",
    "emacs": "$HOME/.config/doom",
    "lf": "$HOME/.config/lf",
    "nvim": "$HOME/.config/nvim/",
    "picom": "$HOME/.config/picom",
    "polybar": "$HOME/.config/polybar",
    "rofi": "$HOME/.config/rofi/",
    "sxiv": "$HOME/.config/sxiv",
    "sxhkd": "$HOME/.config/sxhkd/",
    "wal": "$HOME/.config/wal",
    "xorg": "$HOME",
    "zsh": "$HOME"
}
----

With the tiny manager and the package list, we can then execute commands with all of the packages and its target path with one go.
For the command string, it is a https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template[Python template] with `package` and `location` as the available objects.

[source, shell]
----
# Take the setup as the filesystem structure.
# See the JSON file (locations.json) to see what packages to be installed and where to install them.

# Running the program without any arguments for a test run.
# There should be a bunch of `echo` commands being ran for all of the listed packages.
./vtsm

# Create the directories of the target path and install them with GNU Stow.
# Bada-bing, bada-boom, you have installed your setup or something.
./vtsm --commands "mkdir -p {location} && stow {package} --target {location}"
----


=== Custom scripts

Next are more custom scripts!
They're located in link:bin/[`bin/`] and ideally should be linked in `$HOME/.local/bin`.
footnote:[This is a part of the package list but I think it's appropriate to create a dedicated subsection for this.]

Here's a list of the top most useful scripts (at least for me):

* link:./bin/rofi-screenshot-menu[A Rofi menu for all of my screenshoting and screencasting needs].
The script is also a fork of https://github.com/ceuk/rofi-screenshot[`ceuk's` rofi-screenshot].
Big thanks to them for the idea!

* link:./bin/ocr[An image selection-to-text script using OCR].
Capture a region, process it through an OCR engine, and the content are then copied into the clipboard.
Useful for capturing links in images or videos usually found in lecture videos.

* link:./bin/user-prompt[Quick command prompts].
The script is based from https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/prompt[Luke Smith's prompt script].

* link:./bin/toggle-process[Switching on/off programs].
Useful for situations where only one instance of the program is desirable.

* link:./bin/choose-emoji-menu[A universal emoji list] for easy copy-pasting and clear communication with those who speak Emojian.




== Configured programs

Here's a list of the programs with details on the config found in this repo.
Each of the listed directory is designed to be used/managed with https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow] at the indicated target path.

Each of my configuration also tries to be visually consistent but it is only a secondary priority.
For a color scheme, my main preference is https://www.nordtheme.com/[Nord].


=== https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/[Alacritty]

Similar to https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty[Kitty] , it's a GPU-based terminal emulator.
It's documentation for the configuration can be viewed at the config file itself being filled with comments.

* Config located at link:alacritty/[`alacritty/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/alacritty/`.
* Minimum version (from `alacritty --version`):
** `alacritty 0.3.3`
* Contains a single `alacritty.yaml` as the config file.
Not much has changed except for the color scheme and the font being used.


=== https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm[bspwm]

A minimalist window manager.
Only provides a window manager and nothing else.

* Config located at link:bspwm/[`bspwm/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/bspwm/`.
* Minimum version (from `bspwm --version`):
** `0.9.7-10-g2ffd9c1`
* Simply contains `bspwmrc` which is an executable setting up bspwm-related settings and and starting up some applications.
However, the "true" version is stored as a https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/User-Template-Files[template file] for pywal (located at link:wal/templates/bspwmrc[`wal/templates/bspwmrc`]).
* This allows for a modular setup.
For using keybindings, it uses `sxhkd` (Simple X Hotkey Daemon).
For something similar to i3-bar, https://github.com/polybar/polybar[polybar] serves as the replacement.

To control the window manager, you should use `bspc`.


=== https://dunst-project.org/[Dunst]

It's a notification daemon used to display notifications sent by notifiers (programs that send messages/notifications).

* Config location is at link:dunst/[`dunst/`].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/dunst/`.
* Minimum version (from `dunst --version`):
** `Dunst - A customizable and lightweight notification-daemon 1.4.1 (2019-07-03)`
* Simply contains a `dunstrc` configuring appearance of the notifications.
Though, the "true" version of the config is located at link:wal/templates/dunstrc[`wal/templates/dunstrc`].

Look out for the related manual entry (i.e., `man dunst`) and the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dunst[Arch Wiki entry].


=== https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[GNU Emacs]

Another text editor, of course.
I finally bit the bullet with this one with the native support for https://orgmode.org/[Org Mode] as the biggest reason.
(Is this going to be start of something sinister?)

* This package is really a https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs[Doom Emacs]-based configuration more than the vanilla config so you need to install it first before touching the config with your grubby hands.
Just run the following command `git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d && ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install` and it should take care of the rest.
* Config located at link:emacs/[`emacs/`].
* The ideal target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/doom`.
* Minium version (from `emacs --version`):
** `GNU Emacs 26.3`
** For Doom Emacs, it's not particularly important since it's in rolling release but for future references, it is from the `develop` branch at commit https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/commit/efa599f076c3a140c6b4006c352fdba3361abebd[`efa599f076c3a140c6b4006c352fdba3361abebd`] accessed at 2020-04-24.
* The Doom configs are just the default config and some snippets (in `snippets/`) so there's not much to go through here.
* Regarding theming Doom Emacs, I've found mainly two ways.
** First is simply using https://gitlab.com/jjzmajic/ewal[ewal] but the resulting colors are not pretty IMO and I haven't found a way to customize it aside from forking and modifying the package itself.
** Second is simply generating the Doom Emacs theme file myself;
I have a https://gitlab.com/foo-dogsquared/doom-theme-generator[small script] that is generates one from the Pywal color scheme.
** Or simply don't and use https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes[modus-themes] instead for that light customization options.


=== https://github.com/gokcehan/lf[lf]

A http://ranger.github.io/[ranger]-inspired terminal file manager.
https://godoc.org/github.com/gokcehan/lf[Here's the documentation for it.]

* Config located at link:lf/[`lf/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/lf/`.
* Minimum version (from `lf --version`):
** `r14`
* All of the config files are basically default config files except with a few personal changes.


=== https://neovim.io/[Neovim]

A modern version of https://www.vim.org/[Vim], a modal text editor.
footnote:[Migrated after I've seen https://lukesmith.xyz/[Luke-senpai] used it in his recent videos.
Seriously though, I find nvim to be way better for configuration.]

* Config located at link:nvim/[`nvim/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/nvim`.
* Minimum version (from `nvim --version`):
** `NVIM v0.4.3`
* Uses https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[`vim-plug`] as the plugin manager.
* Contains my plugin list and editor configurations in `init.vim`.
* There are also some https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips[UltiSnips] snippets stored in `own-snippets` folder (since `snippets` is a reserved folder name).
* One of the largest snippet file is the snippets for LaTeX files.
It is based on https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets/[_Gilles Castel_'s UltiSnips LaTeX snippets].


=== https://github.com/yshui/picom[picom]

A window compositor forked from https://github.com/chjj/compton[compton] that adds off-screen buffers and additional effects and animations to the window.
Can be used for adding style to your setup.

This is formerly the Compton configuration.

* Config found at link:picom/[`picom/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/picom`.
* Minimum version (from `picom --version`):
** `v7.2`
* The config is copied from `/etc/xorg/picom.conf` and edited a few parameters.

For documentation, check out the manual entry (i.e., `man picom`) and the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Picom[related Arch Wiki entry].
The default configuration (located at `/etc/xdg/picom.conf` assuming at Arch Linux) can be helpful as well as it is filled with comments.


=== https://github.com/polybar/polybar[polybar]

A tool for creating status bars.

This is the replacement bar from my previous i3-based setup.

* Config located at link:polybar[`polybar/`].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/polybar`.
* Minimum version (from `polybar --version`):
** `polybar 3.4.1`
** `Features: +alsa +curl +i3 +mpd +network(libnl) +pulseaudio +xkeyboard`
* There is only the standalone config (might decide to make it modular) and the launch script which is copied from the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polybar[related Arch Wiki entry].
The theme is dynamically used with the Xresources file (by using `xrdb`).

For documentation, check out the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polybar[already linked Arch Wiki entry] and the https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki[official documentation from GitHub].


=== https://github.com/davatorium/rofi[Rofi]

The application switcher and launcher.
Also serves as a replacement for https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/[dmenu].

* Config located at link:rofi/[`rofi/`].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/rofi/`.
* Minimum version (from `rofi -version`):
** `Version: 1.5.4`
* Main config is `config.rasi`.
* Contains the config and my custom Rofi themes.

To see the documentation, check out the manual entry for `rofi`.
For creating or editing Rofi themes, read the manual entry of `rofi-theme`.
Also, view the related https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rofi[Arch Wiki entry].


=== https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd]

Stands for "Simple X Hotkey Daemon".
It is a hotkey daemon detecting certain X events primarily from the keyboard and mouse.

It is also very useful since it enables modular setup.
Can be used independent of the desktop environment (DE) or the window manager (WM).

* Config located at link:sxhkd/[`sxhkd/`] folder.
* The usual target path is at `$HOME/.config/sxhkd`.
* Minimum version (from `sxhkd --version`):
** `0.6.0-3-g7124055`
* Contains a config file (`sxhkdrc`) for the keybindings.
There are some keybindings specifically used for `bspwm`.


=== https://github.com/muennich/sxiv[sxiv]

A simple developer-oriented X image viewer with a lot of options for customization.

* Config located at link:sxiv/[`sxiv/`] directory.
* The usual target path is at `$HOME/.config/sxiv`.
* Minimum version (from `sxiv -v`):
** `sxiv 26`
* Contains custom keybindings (with `exec/key-handler`) and a configuration for the status bar (with `exec/image-info`).

sxiv has a manual (i.e., `man sxiv`) so that's convenient.
I also recommend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYW9i_u5PYs[Luke Smith's video] introducing it.
That's where I also heard of it.


=== https://www.zsh.org/[Zsh]

A Unix shell and an alternative to the Bash.
Mostly chosen due to its wide options for customization compared to GNU Bash.

* Config found at link:zsh/[`zsh/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/zsh`.
You do have to set `ZDOTDIR=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh` at `/etc/zsh/zshenv` (requires root privilege) though.
* Minimum version (from `zsh --version`):
** `zsh 5.7.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`
* Contains `.zprofile` and `.zshrc`.
The primary file to look for is the `.profile` to set environment variables independent of the shell setups.
* Previously relied on https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/[oh-my-zsh].
Eventually, the config became independent and can work without it.

For the documentation, check out the manual entry for `zsh` to gain an overview of the shell.
The documentation itself is massive and comprehensive.
The main manual explains some things such as the startup/shutdown files and compatibility with other shells.
It also lays out the sections of the manual which you can check it out.

Since the manual has been split into multiple sections, it can be daunting to navigate.
The most referred sections by far are `zshmisc` where it gives details on the miscellanea of zsh such as the prompt and special variables you might want to know.
The other section is `zshbuiltins` where it explains built-in commands of zsh.

For coding with Zsh, look into the http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/index.html[Zsh Manual].
