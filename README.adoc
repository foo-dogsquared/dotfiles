= dotfiles
:toc:

My dotfiles for my Linux-based system setup. 
The structure of this repo is designed to be managed with https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow], a symlinks farm manager. 

I don't know what I'm doing most of the time in creating this setup so if you're brave (or suicidal) enough to take a look at my stuff (that may or may not be an escaped entry from the SCP Foundation), go ahead. 

CAUTION: Don't blindly apply these dotfiles unless you know what you're doing. 
Review the code first, change the setting accordingly, and apply it.

== Wallpapers

Here's a list of the wallpapers I've used throughout my ricing journey. 
I've also tried to get the creators to show appreciation for their work.

== Tour of my setup 

There are a few things to know on this setup. 

* `packages.txt` is mainly for archiving my native package list from the official Arch Linux repos installed in my current Arch Linux setup. 
* `aur-packages.txt` contains the installed packages from AUR along with their versions. 
* `locations.json` is a data file that contains all of the packages listed in <<Configured programs>> along with their target path. 
* `manager.py` is a little manager tailored for this setup. 
* A makefile (named `makefile`) which makes use of GNU Make. 

`packages.txt` and `aur-packages.txt` are simply a list of installed packages from the official Arch repo and AUR respectively. 
 They are going to be committed at the start of every month (if it works that is). 

`manager.py` is a tiny https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow]-inspired manager created for this setup. 
(Nonetheless, I tried to make it generic for other cases.) 
It takes a directory with a file named `locations.json` containing the packages with their target path. 
We can then execute commands with all of the packages and its target path. 
footnote:[Obviously, you need Python installed for this.
For future references, the version by the time first writing the script is at v3.8.1.] 

[source, shell]
----
# Take the setup as the filesystem structure. 
# See the JSON file (locations.json) to see what packages to be installed and where to install them. 

# Running the program without any arguments for a test run. 
# There should be a bunch of `echo` commands being ran for all of the listed packages. 
./manager.py

# Create the directories of the target path and install them with GNU Stow. 
# Bada-bing, bada-boom, you have installed your setup or something. 
./manager.py --commands "mkdir -p {location}" "stow --restow {package} --target {location}"
----

Just execute the script with the `--help` flag for more information. ;p 

Next, more custom scripts. 
They're located in link:bin/[`bin/`] and ideally should be linked in `$PATH`. 
Currently, I have them linked in `$HOME/bin`. 

The scripts are mostly used with hotkey bindings (e.g., `sxhkd`). 
Nonetheless, they could be executed in the shell (provided they are linked in `$PATH`). 

Here's a list of the top most useful scripts:

* link:./bin/screenshot[Screenshot capture]. 
Includes the option of delaying and region selection mode. 

* link:./bin/ocr[An image-to-text script using OCR]. 
The content are then copied into the clipboard. 
Built on top of the screenshot script. 
Useful for capturing links in images or videos. 

* link:./bin/record[Screen recording] using https://ffmpeg.org/[FFmpeg]. 
An option of excluding and/or following the mouse cursor is included. 

* link:./bin/prompt[Quick command prompts]. 
The script is based from https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/prompt[Luke Smith's prompt script]. 

* link:./bin/toggle-bin[Switching on/off programs]. 
Useful for situations where only one instance of the program is running. 

Aside from the scripts, there are also some details and files that are not committed to this setup for privacy and security reasons. 
A few examples of which is my cron setups where it is tasked with updating and committing the package lists to the Git repo, updating the packages, cleaning the cache, and so much more. 




== Configured programs

Here's a list of the programs with details on the config found in this repo. 
Each of the listed directory is designed to be used/managed with https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow] at the indicated target path.


=== https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm[bspwm]

A minimalist window manager. 
Only provides a window manager and nothing else. 

* Config located at link:bspwm/[`bspwm/`] directory. 
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/bspwm/`. 
* Minimum version (from `bspwm --version`):
** `0.9.7-10-g2ffd9c1`
* Simply contains `bspwmrc` which is an executable setting up bspwm-related settings and and starting up some applications. 
* This allows for a modular setup. 
For using keybindings, it uses `sxhkd` (Simple X Hotkey Daemon). 
For something similar to i3-bar, https://github.com/polybar/polybar[polybar] serves as the replacement. 


=== https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd]

Stands for "Simple X Hotkey Daemon". 
It is a hotkey daemon detecting certain X events primarily from the keyboard and mouse. 

It is also very useful since it enables modular setup. 
Can be used independent of the desktop environment (DE) or the window manager (WM). 

* Config located at link:sxhkd/[`sxhkd/`] folder.
* The usual target path is at `$HOME/.config/sxhkd`. 
* Minimum version (from `sxhkd --version`):
** `0.6.0-3-g7124055`
* Contains a config file (`sxhkdrc`) for the keybindings. 
There are some keybindings specifically used for `bspwm`. 


=== https://github.com/polybar/polybar[polybar]

A tool for creating status bars. 

This is the replacement bar from my previous i3-based setup. 

* Config located at link:polybar[`polybar/`]. 
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/polybar`. 
* Minimum version (from `polybar --version`): 
** `polybar 3.4.1`
** `Features: +alsa +curl +i3 +mpd +network(libnl) +pulseaudio +xkeyboard`
* There is only the standalone config (might decide to make it modular) and the launch script which is copied from the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polybar[related Arch Wiki entry]. 

For documentation, check out the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polybar[already linked Arch Wiki entry] and the https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki[official documentation from GitHub]. 


=== https://github.com/davatorium/rofi[Rofi]

The application switcher and launcher. 
Also serves as a replacement for https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/[dmenu].

* Config located at link:rofi/[`rofi/`].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/rofi/`.
* Minimum version (from `rofi -version`):
** `Version: 1.5.4`
* Main config is `config.rasi`.
* Contains the config and my custom Rofi themes. 

To see the documentation, check out the manual entry for `rofi`. 
For creating or editing Rofi themes, read the manual entry of `rofi-theme`. 
Also, view the related https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rofi[Arch Wiki entry]. 


=== https://www.zsh.org/[Zsh]

A Unix shell and an alternative to the Bash.

* Config found at link:zsh/[`zsh/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/`.
* Minimum version (from `zsh --version`):
** `zsh 5.7.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`
* Contains `.zprofile` and `.zshrc`. 
The primary file to look for is the `.profile` to set environment variables independent of the shell setups. 
* Previously relied on https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/[oh-my-zsh]. 
Eventually, the config became independent and can work without it. 

For the documentation, check out the manual entry for `zsh` to gain an overview of the shell. 
The main manual explains some things such as the startup/shutdown files and compatibility with other shells. 
It also lays out the sections of the manual which you can check it out. 

Since the manual has been split into multiple sections, it can be daunting to navigate. 
The most referred sections by far are `zshmisc` where it gives details on the miscellanea of zsh such as the prompt and special variables you might want to know. 
The other section is `zshbuiltins` where it explains built-in commands of zsh. 


=== https://www.x.org/wiki/[Xorg]

A display server implementing X window system.

* Config found at link:xorg/[`xorg/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/`.
* Minimum version (from `Xorg -version`):
** `X.Org X Server 1.20.5`
** `X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0`
* The configuration is found at `.Xresources` containing the colors (0 to 15, foreground, and the background). 


=== https://github.com/yshui/picom[picom]

Can be used for adding style to your setup. 

This is formerly the Compton configuration. 

* Config found at link:picom/[`picom/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/picom`.
* Minimum version (from `picom --version`):
** `v7.2`
* The config is copied from `/etc/xorg/picom.conf` and edited a few parameters. 

For documentation, check out the manual entry (i.e., `man picom`) and the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Picom[related Arch Wiki entry]. 
The default configuration (located at `/etc/xdg/picom.conf` assuming at Arch Linux) can be helpful as well as it is filled with comments. 


=== https://neovim.io/[Neovim]

A modern version of https://www.vim.org/[Vim], a modal text editor. 
footnote:[Migrated after I've seen https://lukesmith.xyz/[Luke-senpai] used it in his recent videos. 
Seriously though, I find nvim to be way better for configuration.]

* Config located at link:nvim/[`nvim/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/nvim`.
* Minimum version (from `nvim --version`): 
** `NVIM v0.4.3` 
* Uses https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[`vim-plug`] as the plugin manager.
* Contains my plugin list and editor configurations in `init.vim`.
* There are also some https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips[UltiSnips] snippets stored in `own-snippets` folder (since `snippets` is a reserved folder name). 
* One of the largest snippet file is the snippets for LaTeX files. 
It is based on https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets/[_Gilles Castel_'s UltiSnips LaTeX snippets].


=== https://ranger.github.io/[Ranger]

A Vim-based file browser. 
https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki[Here's their config documentation for it.]

* Config located at link:ranger/[`ranger/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/ranger/`.
* Minimum version (from `ranger --version`):
** `ranger version: ranger 1.9.2`
** `Python version: 3.7.4 (default, Jul 16 2019, 07:12:58) [GCC 9.1.0]`
* All of the config files are basically default config files except with a few changes.
* Contains keybinding in `rc.conf`. Additional keybindings include the `O` keybinding and their variants for opening my go-to programs such as https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code].
* `rifle.conf` contains configuration for opening a list of programs. 


=== https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/[Alacritty]

Similar to https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty[Kitty] , it's a GPU-based terminal emulator. 
It's documentation for the configuration can be viewed at the config file itself being filled with comments.

* Config located at link:alacritty/[`alacritty/`] directory.
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/alacritty/`.
* Minimum version (from `alacritty --version`):
** `alacritty 0.3.3`
* Contains a single `alacritty.yaml` as the config file. Not much has changed except for the color scheme and the font being used.


=== https://dunst-project.org/[Dunst]

It's a notification daemon used to display notifications sent by notifiers (programs that send messages/notifications).

* Config location is at link:dunst/[`dunst/`].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/dunst/`.
* Minimum version (from `dunst --version`):
** `Dunst - A customizable and lightweight notification-daemon 1.4.1 (2019-07-03)`
* Simply contains a `dunstrc` configuring appearance of the notifications. 

Look out for the related manual entry (i.e., `man dunst`) and the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dunst[Arch Wiki entry]. 


=== https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/[pacman]

The default package manager for Arch Linux.

* Config location is at link:pacman/[`pacman/`]
* The usual target path is at `/etc/pacman.d`.
* Minimum version (from `pacman --version`):
** `Pacman v5.1.3 - libalpm v11.0.3`
* Contains the configuration file, a `mirrorlist` file, and some https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?ip_version=6[pacman hooks].
* For the mirrorlist, change it accordingly or https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?ip_version=6[generate another one]. 
It is also monthly updated from a cron job. 
* The dotfiles repo also contains two package lists (i.e., `packages.txt` and `aur-packages.txt`) in the root of the project folder. 
* The setup also uses `yay` as the AUR helper tool. 


=== https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal[Pywal] 

Pywal is a tool for generating color schemes from an image. 
It is mainly used to produce templates for different applications (e.g., Vim, Visual Studio, the tty). 

* The config directory is at `wal`. 
* The usual target path would be on `~/.local/share/wal`. 
The target path is more lenient since it only contains data files. 
You have more choices here. 
* Minimum version (from `wal -v`):
** `wal 3.3.0` 
* The folder only contains the best of the themes in JSON files. 
All of the data files are named after the filenames of the wallpapers. 
A few of them are listed in the <<Wallpapers>> section for the sources. 
The JSON files does need a little bit of tweaking especially with the `wallpaper` key. 
You could apply them with `wal --theme /path/to/file`. 
* To easily create some more themes into JSON, I've created a small script named `create-wal-theme` located in my custom scripts location.
