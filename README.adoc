= dotfiles
:toc:

My dotfiles for my Linux-based system setup. 
The structure of this repo is designed to be managed with https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow], a symlinks farm manager.

Don't blindly apply these dotfiles unless you know what you're doing. 
Review the code first, change the setting accordingly, and apply it.

== Screenshots
My setup was made by the FOSS gang.

== Specifications
Here are the main specifications of my machine currently running this (as of 2019-08-09):

* **Operating system**: https://www.archlinux.org/[Arch Linux]
* **Display server**: X Window System using https://www.x.org/wiki/[Xorg]
* **Window manager**: https://i3wm.org/[i3] (specifically https://github.com/Airblader/i3[i3-gaps])

* **Shell**: http://www.zsh.org/[Zsh]
* **Terminal emulator font**: https://github.com/be5invis/iosevka[Iosevka]

Terminal color scheme was generated with https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal[pywal]. 
The picture is used to generate the color pallete is https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/cckpj0/i_made_this_simple_and_clean_drawing_over_the/[this one]. 
It's also the wallpaper used in the screenshots.


== Wallpapers
Here are the wallpapers' filename along with their sources:

== Custom scripts
My own scripts is in link:.scripts/[`.scripts/`] and should be linked in `$HOME/.scripts`.
This is mostly used for using scripts from different configs such as from i3 and dunst.


== Configured programs
Here's a list of the programs with details on the config found in this repo. 
Each of the directory is designed to be used/managed with https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow] at the indicated target path.

It is based on https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets/[_Gilles Castel_'s UltiSnips LaTeX snippets].

=== https://ranger.github.io/[Ranger]
A Vim-based file browser. 
https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki[Here's their config documentation for it.]

* All of the config files are basically default config files except with a few changes.
* Contains keybinding in `rc.conf`. Additional keybindings include the `O` keybinding and their variants for opening my go-to programs such as https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code].
* `rifle.conf` contains configuration for opening a list of programs. 

=== https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/[Alacritty]
Similar to https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty[Kitty] , it's a GPU-based terminal emulator. 
It's documentation for the configuration can be viewed at the config file itself being filled with comments.

=== https://github.com/Airblader/i3[i3-gaps] 
A fork of i3 window manager. 
https://i3wm.org/docs[Here's the documentation page of the program.]

* If it's any of importance, the configuration is prone to be moved for the https://github.com/i3/i3/[original version of i3] since https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/3724[there's consideration for merging of gaps into i3].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/i3/`.
* Config located at link:i3/[`i3/`] directory.
* Minimum version (from `i3 --version`):
** `i3 version 4.17 (04.08.2019) Â© 2009 Michael Stapelberg and contributors`
* Uses https://github.com/davatorium/rofi[`rofi`] as the application launcher and serves as a replacement for https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/[`dmenu`].
* The containing config (`config`) is simply the default config with my personal config added into it. 
Not much to say here except I use `i3bar` (the default bar) and https://github.com/i3/i3status[`i3status`] (the default status bar config) to fill in.
* The config for `i3status` is located in a different directory at link:i3status[`i3status/`] containing a single `config` file (for now).
* Also, it uses scripts from the link:.scripts/[`.scripts/`] directory so be sure to put those in the appropriate location as well.

=== https://github.com/davatorium/rofi[Rofi]
The application switcher and launcher. 
Also serves as a replacement for https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/[dmenu].

* Config located at link:rofi/[`rofi/`].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/rofi/`.
* Minimum version (from `rofi -version`):
** `Version: 1.5.4`
* Main config is `config.rasi`.
* My i3 setup uses Rofi with my custom theme (`fds-sidebar`) with `$mod+D` (see image above). Every variation of my sidebar theme should import the common file (`fds-sidebar-common.rasi`) and only declare the colors. 
See `fds-sidebar-dark.rasi` for an example. 

=== https://www.gtk.org/[GTK]
A library for creating programs with graphical user interface (GUI).

There are often two versions when configuring GTK: version 2 and 3.

* Version depends on the program itself since it is usually statically linked within the GUI program.
* GTK3 config located at link:gtk3/[`gtk3/`].
* The usual target path of GTK3 for a user is at `$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/`.
* Simply contains a `settings.ini` file that contains common configuration that'll be applied for most GTK3 apps (Thunar, Inkscape, etc.).
* GTK2 config located at link:gtk2/[`gkt2/`].
* The usual target path of GTK2 for a user is at `$HOME/` because of the `.gtkrc-2.0` file needs to at `$HOME/`.
* GTK color and icon theme is https://github.com/NicoHood/arc-theme[Arc theme] 
and uses the light dark variation (`arc-darker`).

=== https://dunst-project.org/[Dunst]
It's a notification daemon used to display notifications sent by notifiers (programs that send messages/notifications).

* Config location is at link:dunst/[`dunst/`].
* The usual target path for a user is at `$HOME/.config/dunst/`.
* Minimum version (from `dunst --version`):
** `Dunst - A customizable and lightweight notification-daemon 1.4.1 (2019-07-03)`
* Simply contains a `dunstrc` configuring appearance of the notifications.

The default package manager for Arch Linux.

* Config location is at link:pacman/[`pacman/`]

** `Pacman v5.1.3 - libalpm v11.0.3`
* Contains the configuration file, a `mirrorlist` file, and some https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?ip_version=6[pacman hooks].
* For the mirrorlist, change it accordingly or https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?ip_version=6[generate another one].
