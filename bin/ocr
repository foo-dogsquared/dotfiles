# A script that utilizes OCR for a screenshot and copies the text to the clipboard.

# Dependencies:
# * tesseract 4.1.1
# * leptonica-1.79.0
# * The Tesseract English data
# * Image libraries (e.g., `libgif`, `libwebp`)
# * xclip - version 0.13
# * maim - version 5.6.3

# It's a small script anyways so why not.
# I feel like this is one of the appropriate solutions especially that there is potential for erreneous feedback.
